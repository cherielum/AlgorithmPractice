//Things learning right now..
//<ArrayList> is hybrid between array and list
//There are queues and stacks
//Stacks mean you put something in (push) and take things out from the top (pop).
//Queues mean you put something in from the back (queue) and you take things out from the front (dequeue).

//Learned today
//When you eliminate a node, you bypass it all together and the one you skip goes to the trash.

//Nodes are predefined functions
